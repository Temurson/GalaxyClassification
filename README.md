# GalaxyClassification
Student project on galaxy classification using Machine Learning.
The work is based on the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge.
Accuracy reached is around 80%. Compared to the competition in the link above, the program at hand is simplified, so it only looks at the first data column - galaxy type.
You can look at Presentation.pdf for more information.
